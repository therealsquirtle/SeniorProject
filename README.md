SeniorProject
=============

The Senior Project for Chae`launa Tate.  This is  a character creator for the tabletop game dungeons and dragons

SETUP
1.  Open the file named “Setup”
2.  Open the file named “Setup.exe” This will install the program and put a link to it in your programs folder.
3.  Open the programs folder and search for “CharacterCreator” Opening this will bring up the main screen.

MY CODE
 I believe I may have fixed the issue with my code, by referencing the database through a process instead of accessing it directly.

CITES
The original code for the DiceRoller function was created by Marty Fitzgerald.  It is located in the Program.cs file in my solution. There is a comment in the function where his code is.  I also have a separate function that was modified from his original code.  This is also commented on in the code.
